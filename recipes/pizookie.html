    <p>
      Yes, you can have a pizookie without heating up the oven! This air fryer
      recipe is simple, delicious, and really good if you just need something
      low-effort but satisfying. Top with gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle
      of melted chocolate, or anything you like.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        5 pieces pre-cut refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough (such as
        Pillsbury™ Ready to Bake!™ Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough)
      </li>
      <li>1 scoop vanilla gelato (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
      <li>1 ounce chocolate, melted, to drizzle (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Get a large piece of aluminum foil and fold it into an 8x8-inch square.
        You can make a little dish out of the foil by folding the edges upward.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1 piece of cookie dough in the middle of your foil. Arrange
        remaining cookie dough pieces around it in a pattern similar to the
        5-side of a die.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cookie in the air fryer for 6 minutes. Open the air fryer and
        gently push down the top of the cookie; continue to bake until deep
        golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle of melted chocolate, and enjoy!
